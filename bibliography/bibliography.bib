abstract = "In this paper, the authors introduce two bicriterion routing problems: the median tour problem (MTP) and the maximal covering tour problem (MCTP). In both problems the tour must visit only p of the n nodes on the network. In addition, both problems have as one of their objectives the minimization of total tour length. The second objective in both problems maximizes access to the tour for the nodes not directly on it. In the MTP, the access objective is the minimization of the total travel distance necessary for demand at the nodes to reach their nearest stop on the tour. In the MCTP, the access objective is to maximize the total demand within some prespecified maximal travel distance from a tour stop. It is shown that the MCTP may be viewed as a special case of the MTP; consequently, solution procedures developed for the MTP may also be employed to solve the MCTP. Unfortunately, both problems are NP-hard. In addition, the number of efficient solutions may grow exponentially with the number of nodes in the particular problem instance. Consequently a heuristic procedure is developed to generate a good approximation of the efficient frontier. Not only does this approximation provide the decision marker with insight into the magnitudes of the inherent tradeoffs between the two objectives, but it also provides him or her with a set of feasible options to consider. Computational experience, on a realistically scaled problem, is provided. Applications of the problems include the design of mobile service delivery systems (e.g. healthcare delivery in rural areas of developing countries), bi-modal transportation systems (e.g. overnight mail delivery), and distributed computer networks, among others."

abstract = "In the Median Cycle Problem the aim is to determine a simple cycle containing a subset of vertices of a graph, while considering two types of cost: routing costs associated with the cycle itself, and the cost of assigning vertices not on the cycle to vertices of the cycle. Two versions of the problem are investigated. In the first, the objective function is the sum of routing and assignment costs. In the second, routing costs are minimized, subject to an upper bound on the total assignment cost. The two versions are formulated as integer linear programs. The polyhedral structure of the first model is analyzed and the second model is strengthened through the introduction of additional valid inequalities. Separation procedures are developed. Heuristic procedures and an exact branch-and-cut algorithm are described. Computational results on benchmark instances and on randomly generated problems confirm the efficiency of the proposed algorithms."

abstract = {Abstract In the Ring Star Problem, the aim is to locate a simple cycle through a subset of vertices of a graph with the objective of minimizing the sum of two costs: a ring cost proportional to the length of the cycle and an assignment cost from the vertices not in the cycle to their closest vertex on the cycle. The problem has several applications in telecommunications network design and in rapid transit systems planning. It is an extension of the classical location–allocation problem introduced in the early 1960s, and closely related versions have been recently studied by several authors. This article formulates the problem as a mixed-integer linear program and strengthens it with the introduction of several families of valid inequalities. These inequalities are shown to be facet-defining and are used to develop a branch-and-cut algorithm. Computational results show that instances involving up to 300 vertices can be solved optimally using the proposed methodology.},

abstract = "This article concerns the location of satellite distribution centers (SDCs) to supply humanitarian aid to the affected people throughout a disaster area. In such situations, it is not possible for the relief teams to visit every single home. Instead, the people are required to go to a satellite distribution center in order to obtain survival goods, provided that these centers are not too far from their homes. The SDCs are usually within walking distance. However, these SDCs need to be supplied from a central depot, using a heterogeneous and capacitated fleet of vehicles. We model this situation as a generalization of the covering tour problem, introduce the idea of split delivery, and propose an efficient heuristic approach to solve it. Numerical experiments on randomly-generated data show that, first, only very small instances can be solved efficiently using the mathematical model and, second, our heuristic produces high-quality solutions and solves real-size instances in a reasonable computing time."

The problem is modelled as a capacitated and distance constrained open vehicle routing problem and an associated integer linear program is presented. The integer program borrows some well-known inequalities from the vehicle routing problem, which are also shown to be valid for the SBRP under consideration. The optimal solution of the problem is computed using the proposed formulation, resulting in a saving of up to 28.6\% in total travelling cost as compared to the current implementation. }

There exists a number of applications of the DMP in the fields of distribution and machine scheduling. The DMP is NP-hard. The objective of this paper is to develop new theoretical results and an exact algorithm for the problem. A new, integer linear programming formulation is provided, and results on the matroidal structure of a class of combinatorial problems are developed. These are used to derive lower bounds for the DMP. These bounds are embedded into an enumerative algorithm. The largest problems solved to optimality with the proposed algorithm involve 60 vertices. This compares favorably with previously published methods. }

Two mixed integer linear programming formulations are presented for this problem: a classical arc flow model and a sequential assignment model. Several polyhedral results are provided for the second formulation, in the special case arising when there is a closed time window only at the depot, while open time windows are considered at all other locations. Exact and heuristic algorithms are also proposed for the problem. Computational results show that medium size instances can be solved exactly with both models, while the heuristic provides good quality solutions for medium to large size instances."

The length of the path is assumed to be bounded by a given maximum length. At each vertex of the network (customer-point) the demand for the service is given and the cost to reach the closest service-point is computed. The objective is to minimize the sum of these costs over all the customer-points in the network. We consider two local search metaheuristics, the well known Tabu search and the Old bachelor acceptance and we propose a comparative analysis of the performances of the two procedures. We implement streamlined versions of Tabu search and Old bachelor acceptance. Our main concern is to provide knowledge about the intrinsic strategy adopted by each metaheuristic and to know whether one is more appropriate than the other for our problem."

This type of challenges arises whenever priority is given to the satisfaction of the customer need, e.g. vital goods supply or rescue after a natural disaster. The CCVRP generalizes the NP-hard traveling repairman problem (TRP), by adding capacity constraints and a homogeneous vehicle fleet. This paper presents the first upper and lower bounding procedures for this new problem. The lower bounds are derived from CCVRP properties. Upper bounds are given by a memetic algorithm using non-trivial evaluations of cost variations in the local search. Good results are obtained not only on the CCVRP, but also on the special case of the TRP, outperforming the only TRP metaheuristic published."
