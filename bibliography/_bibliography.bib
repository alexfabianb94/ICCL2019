abstract = "During the last decade, a number of challenging applications in logistics, tourism and other fields were modelled as orienteering problems (OP). In the orienteering problem, a set of vertices is given, each with a score. The goal is to determine a path, limited in length, that visits some vertices and maximises the sum of the collected scores. In this paper, the literature about the orienteering problem and its applications is reviewed. The OP is formally described and many relevant variants are presented. All published exact solution approaches and (meta) heuristics are discussed and compared. Interesting open research questions concerning the OP conclude this paper."

abstract = "In this paper, the authors introduce two bicriterion routing problems: the median tour problem (MTP) and the maximal covering tour problem (MCTP). In both problems the tour must visit only p of the n nodes on the network. In addition, both problems have as one of their objectives the minimization of total tour length. The second objective in both problems maximizes access to the tour for the nodes not directly on it. In the MTP, the access objective is the minimization of the total travel distance necessary for demand at the nodes to reach their nearest stop on the tour. In the MCTP, the access objective is to maximize the total demand within some prespecified maximal travel distance from a tour stop. It is shown that the MCTP may be viewed as a special case of the MTP; consequently, solution procedures developed for the MTP may also be employed to solve the MCTP. Unfortunately, both problems are NP-hard. In addition, the number of efficient solutions may grow exponentially with the number of nodes in the particular problem instance. Consequently a heuristic procedure is developed to generate a good approximation of the efficient frontier. Not only does this approximation provide the decision marker with insight into the magnitudes of the inherent tradeoffs between the two objectives, but it also provides him or her with a set of feasible options to consider. Computational experience, on a realistically scaled problem, is provided. Applications of the problems include the design of mobile service delivery systems (e.g. healthcare delivery in rural areas of developing countries), bi-modal transportation systems (e.g. overnight mail delivery), and distributed computer networks, among others."

In recent decades, the TPP attracted the attention of both researchers in combinatorial optimization and practitioners, thanks to its double nature of procurement and transportation problem. The problem has been used to model several application contexts and is computationally challenging, dealing at the same time with the suppliers selection, the optimization of the purchasing plan and the routing decisions of the purchaser. For the first time after 50 years from its birth, we survey all the research done on the TPP including the most interesting and best performing solution methods proposed so far. We conclude providing some interesting future developments."

A single vehicle is available to collect the profit and the objective is to find the vehicle route that maximizes the profit collected and such that the route duration does not exceed a given threshold. We propose a mathematical formulation of the problem and a matheuristic algorithm. Computational tests are made on instances derived from benchmark instances for the Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem with up 1084 vertices. Results show that the matheuristic produces robust and high-quality solutions in a short computing time."

A number of typical variants has been studied, such as the Team OP, the (Team) OP with Time Windows and the Time Dependent OP. Recently, a number of new variants of the OP was introduced, such as the Stochastic OP, the Generalized OP, the Arc OP, the Multi-agent OP, the Clustered OP and others. This paper focuses on a comprehensive and thorough survey of recent variants of the OP, including the proposed solution approaches. Moreover, the OP has been used as a model in many different practical applications. The most recent applications of the OP, such as the Tourist Trip Design Problem and the mobile-crowdsourcing problem are discussed. Finally, we also present some promising topics for future research."

Conclusions emphasize the interest of this class of problems, with respect to applications as well as theoretical results. }

However, many applications exist where closest assignment (CA) is preferred. Several types of constraints have been introduced over the last 25 years to force CA. The objectives of this paper are to identify applications for closest assignment constraints, to review previous work, to propose necessary improvements to one of the major CA constraints, and to offer a comparison of the different integer-linear approaches to CA. In addition, new constraints are presented that are designed to ensure equal allocations in the event of equidistant closest facilities. We also note, as have previous researchers, that “closest assignment” generalizes to “most preferred” assignment with no alterations to constraint structures."

By considering the group influence, an improved method is further improved. To avoid locking into local minima, a mutation process and a local searching technique are also introduced into this method. Numerical results show that the proposed method can deal with the GTSP problems fairly well, and the developed mutation process and local search technique are effective."

To solve this problem, a mixed integer nonlinear programming model is formulated, and a two-phase matheuristic algorithm that consists of a tabu search method and a nonlinear programming is implemented. Extensive computational experiments are conducted on both randomly generated instances and instances that are adapted from the TSPLIB. The results show that our proposed matheuristic algorithm could be quite effective in finding good-quality solutions."
